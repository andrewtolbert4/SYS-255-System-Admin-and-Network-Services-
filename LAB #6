To map a network drive using group policy prefences, you must first go into the group policy management page. 
Then you need to create a new GPO and go into edit.
From there you go to user configuration->Preferences->Windows Settings->Drive Maps. 
Here you have to try and create it by setting a name, choosing a drive letter and making sure you choose to create.
Then you must go to the group where you want to set the policy to and select link existing GPO.
Then you go back to the machine and do gpresult /r to check if anything is set in the group policy.
If nothing has you may need to reset using the gpupdate /force command.

After completing this lab I went back into some of the interesting topics within the sections. The first one I took a deeper dive into was the toher things that can be changed through the use of sconfig. 
I found many different things including remote desktop availability, the date and time of the machine, and setting updates or checking for updates.
I then went back and looked into some of the other server roles. Some that caught my eye were Remote Desktop Services(RDS), Hyper-V, and Windows Server Update Services(WSUS). Not sure if we will use these in the future.
I then finally went back into the file server resource manager to see some of the other options. This included File Management Tasks, Classification Management, and Quota Management.
