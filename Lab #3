This lab started with me going into the dhcp machine for the first time. I followed the video tutorial which instructed me to get to the network settings and to change the required categories.
I then tested this by pinging google, fw, and ad.
I then went into the WKS workstation and successfully pinged the dhcp machine after adding it to the DNS.
After that I went into powershell and accessed the dhcp machine through ssh. This then allowed me to access many other commands that were run on the other machine.
Following this the lab was complete. I then tested around some other commands like mv(allows you to move and rename files), uname(shows basic information about the operating system), and grep(searches for a string that has output).
