The first step is to go into your server manager, right click on fs01 and choose add roles and features. 
Following this you go through the settings and choose dhcp as a new role and install. Then you finish setting up DHCP.
Then you need to do the same thing for ad02 but instead of roles you go into features and add dhcp tools and install.
Then you need to go into your dhcp, right click on fs01 and add new scope. You then go through these settings adding in certain things like a name, a ip range and length, exclusions, and the lease duration. 
You then go back into your workstation and use the command ipconfig /release to release the current IP configuration and the ipconfig /renew to get a new one. This will then give you the new IP address and a new DHCP address.
